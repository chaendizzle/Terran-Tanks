The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1474414933]EK - Sylvian Mettle[/url] mod is recommended to be played with this mod for balance reasons, since otherwise many of these units are overpowered.

---TERRAN---

 - Battlecruiser: Large, expensive all-purpose airship armed with 4 autocannons. Also has a slow-charging but very high damage Yamato gun. Can attack both land and air. Built from the Tier 2 Air Factory.

 - Dropship: Cheap and effective transport aircraft. Cannot attack, but can transport up to 8 units. Built from the Tier 1 Air Factory.

 - Goliath: Balanced anti-air missile mech that also has a chaingun attack against land targets. Built from the Tier 2 Mech Factory.

 - Marine: Cheap, quick infantry unit with high damage for its cost. Can use Stim Pack to temporarily increase fire rate and movement speed at the cost of health. Very weak against splash damage. Can attack both land and air. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.

 - Missile Turret: Anti-air turret with a devastating splash-damage missile attack. Can also shoot cloaked (and underwater) units. Built by the builder.

 - Siege Tank: Tank unit that can transform between a mobile, short-range tank mode, and an immobile, long-range siege mode. Siege mode can effectively destroy groups of small units and static defenses, but cannot easily escape danger. Can attack land only. Built from the Tier 2 Land Factory.

 - Valkyrie: Fast-firing missile cruiser that deals splash damage. Can attack both land and air, but is more effective against air targets. Strong against groups of air units, and weak to anti-air defenses and large, heavy-hitting single targets. Built from the Tier 2 Air Factory.

 - Vulture: Fast, cheap hoverbike that has a weak land attack, but can lay underground mines that can destroy groups of units. Built from the Tier 2 Land Factory.

 - Wraith: Air superiority fighter with a light land attack. Can temporarily cloak to slip past enemy defenses. Strong against large air targets when massed, but weak against land-based anti-air and splash damage anti-air options. Built from the Tier 1 Air Factory.


---PROTOSS---

 - Carrier: Large, expensive shielded airship that cannot attack, but can create masses of cheap interceptors that swarm an area, and then expire after a period of time. Building interceptors costs credits, and managing the interceptor counts can require a higher degree of micromanagement than with most units. The interceptors can attack both land and air. The carrier is built from the Tier 2 Air Factory.

 - Dragoon: Heavily armored and shielded robotic walker with a photon cannon that attacks both land and air targets. Does not deal much damage per second, but has a high health pool. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.

 - Void Ray: Anti-Shield cruiser armed with a heavy laser. Does high shield damage, but struggles against masses of units and non-shielded targets. Can use Prismatic Alignment to temporarily double attack power for 10 seconds. Can attack both land and air. Built from the Tier 2 Air Factory.

 - Zealot: Cheap, fast melee unit that has a high health and shield pool for its cost. Can only attack land targets, since it is a melee unit. Effective in small groups. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.


---ZERG---

 - Hydralisk: Lightly armored biological alien that can shoot spines at enemies. Does high damage per second, but is weak to splash damage. Can attack both land and air. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.


---JOKE UNITS---

 - Bob: Fully voiced joke unit that consists of a pirate that uses a flaming eyeball to bring death to its enemies. Can transform into an immobile siege mode that grants a measly 10 shield. Can only attack land. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.

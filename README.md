The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1474414933]EK - Sylvian Mettle[/url] mod is recommended to be played with this mod for balance reasons, since otherwise many of these units are overpowered.

---TERRAN---

 - Battlecruiser: Large, expensive all-purpose airship armed with 4 autocannons. Also has a slow-charging but very high damage Yamato gun. Can attack both land and air. Built from the Tier 2 Air Factory.

 - Dropship: Cheap and effective transport aircraft. Cannot attack, but can transport up to 8 units. Built from the Tier 1 Air Factory.

 - Firebat: Flamethrower infantry unit with high health and splash damage for its cost, but short range. Trades very well against large numbers of small, low-health units, but is weak against air units, splash damage, and large, heavily armored units. Can attack land only. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.

 - Goliath: Balanced anti-air missile mech that also has a chaingun attack against land targets. Built from the Tier 2 Mech Factory.

 - Marine: Cheap, quick infantry unit with high damage for its cost. Can use Stim Pack to temporarily increase fire rate and movement speed at the cost of health. Very weak against splash damage. Can attack both land and air. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.

 - Missile Turret: Anti-air turret with a devastating splash-damage missile attack. Can also shoot cloaked (and underwater) units. Built by the builder.

 - Siege Tank: Tank unit that can transform between a mobile, short-range tank mode, and an immobile, long-range siege mode. Siege mode can effectively destroy groups of small units and static defenses, but cannot easily escape danger. Can attack land only. Built from the Tier 2 Land Factory.

 - Valkyrie: Fast-firing missile cruiser that deals splash damage. Can attack both land and air, but is more effective against air targets. Strong against groups of air units, and weak to anti-air defenses and large, heavy-hitting single targets. Built from the Tier 2 Air Factory.

 - Vulture: Fast, cheap hoverbike that has a weak land attack, but can lay underground mines that can destroy groups of units. Built from the Tier 2 Land Factory.

 - Wraith: Air superiority fighter with a light land attack. Can temporarily cloak to slip past enemy defenses. Strong against large air targets when massed, but weak against land-based anti-air and splash damage anti-air options. Built from the Tier 1 Air Factory.


---PROTOSS---

 - Archon: A powerful psionic entity with a large amount of shields and a powerful splash-damage melee attack. Easily destroyed by anti-shield and shield-piercing units, but is effective at soaking up damage and destroying groups of small units. Created by transforming a High Templar into an Archon.

 - Carrier: Large, expensive shielded airship that cannot attack, but can create masses of cheap interceptors that swarm an area, and then expire after a period of time. Building interceptors costs credits, and managing the interceptor counts can require a higher degree of micromanagement than with most units. The interceptors can attack both land and air. The carrier is built from the Tier 2 Air Factory.

 - Dragoon: Heavily armored and shielded robotic walker with a photon cannon that attacks both land and air targets. Does not deal much damage per second, but has a high health pool. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.

 - High Templar: A fragile spellcaster that can summon powerful psionic storms. These storms deal damage over time in a large area of effect, and can singlehandedly destroy masses of air and ground units. High Templar can also transform into an Archon, a powerful psionic entity with a large amount of shields and a powerful splash damage attack. High Templar also have a weak lightning attack against ground and air. Built from the Experimental Factory.

 - Void Ray: Anti-Shield cruiser armed with a heavy laser. Does high shield damage, but struggles against masses of units and non-shielded targets. Can use Prismatic Alignment to temporarily double attack power for 10 seconds. Can attack both land and air. Built from the Tier 2 Air Factory.

 - Zealot: Cheap, fast melee unit that has a high health and shield pool for its cost. Can only attack land targets, since it is a melee unit. Effective in small groups. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.


---ZERG---

 - Hydralisk: Lightly armored biological alien that can shoot spines at enemies. Does high damage per second, but is weak to splash damage. Can attack both land and air. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.

 - Roach: Armored biological crawler that can spit acid at enemies. Has a lot of health for its cost, and can also burrow underground to rapidly regenerate health. Strong when used in small groups, but loses effectiveness when facing splash damage or units that can shoot its burrowed form. The roach can only shoot land targets, so air units are effective against roaches as well. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.

 - Swarm Host: Armored creature that cannot attack directly, but can periodically spawn free locusts that spit acid spines. Locusts have a powerful land-only attack, but automatically expire after enough time passes. Good for sieging a lightly defended area for free, but has no defenses against air and is also vulnerable while preparing the next locust wave. Built from the Tier 2 Land Factory.

 - Ultralisk: Gigantic armored alien creature that can sustain a lot of damage and rip targets apart with its claws. Good at soaking up damage and dealing damage to single targets, but weak to masses of ranged units and armor-piercing attacks. Built from the Experimental Factory.

 - Zergling: Dog-like biological alien that runs quickly and can attack with claws. Good for scouting and early game harrassment, but is easily destroyed by any splash damage attacks. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.


---JOKE UNITS---

 - Bob: Fully voiced joke unit that consists of a pirate that uses a flaming eyeball to bring death to its enemies. Can transform into an immobile siege mode that grants a measly 10 shield. Can only attack land. Built from the Tier 1 Land Factory.
